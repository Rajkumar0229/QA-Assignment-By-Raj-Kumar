## 5. Test Data Management
- Test data will be managed using:
  - Hardcoded test data in test methods
  - Data providers for data-driven tests
  - Configuration properties for environment-specific data

## 6. Test Execution
- Tests will be executed using TestNG test suite
- Parallel test execution for faster execution
- Headless mode for CI/CD pipeline

## 7. Reporting
- Extent Reports for detailed test execution reports
- Screenshots for failed test cases
- Console logs for debugging

## 8. Defect Management
- Defects will be logged with:
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs Actual results
  - Screenshots
  - Environment details
  - Severity and priority

## 9. Exit Criteria
- All critical test cases must pass
- No blocker or critical defects should remain open
- Test coverage should be at least 80% for critical paths

## 10. Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Changes in UI elements | High | Use Page Object Model for better maintainability |
| Test data dependency | Medium | Create independent test data for each test |
| Environment instability | High | Have a stable test environment and retry mechanism |
| Browser compatibility | Medium | Test on multiple browsers and versions |

## 11. Dependencies
- Stable test environment
- Test data availability
- Access to application under test
- Required test accounts and permissions

## 12. Sign-off

| Role | Name | Approval | Date |
